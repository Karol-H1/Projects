# Wordle
This is a version of wordle that I have created. It is written in python and played in the terminal. It starts off by asking to enter a file name to extract words from to create a list of words. Then the player can enter words into the terminal to submit guesses. Each letter in a guess will receive feedback being G for green, Y for yellow, and X if the letter is not in the word. The player gets a maximum of 6 guesses to guess the word and is offered to play the game after the 6 guesses or if the word is guessed.
